# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the `game.py` file.
2. You will be prompted to choose the size of the board (standard is 3x3).
3. Players will take turns entering their moves by inputting the row and column numbers.
4. The game will continue until one player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).
5. Enjoy playing!

## Files

- `game.py`: Main Python script containing the game logic.
- `README.md`: This file providing instructions and information about the game.

## Requirements

- Python 3

## Additional Notes

- The game allows for customization of the board size, so you can play larger versions of Tic-Tac-Toe if desired.
- This implementation does not include an AI opponent, so it's a two-player game.
